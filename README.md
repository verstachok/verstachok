- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @verstachok

I'm html coder. In the process of my work, I use the following development tools:
- npm managing the necessary packages for node.js
- node.js for javascript to work
- sass for nesting, variables and mixins
- bootstrap for grid system
- swiper.js for sliders
- gulp in conjunction with webpack for process automation
- git for project version control
